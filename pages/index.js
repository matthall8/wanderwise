                    Iâ€™ll never forget the week I arrived in Bogota, to begin my first backpacking trip. The excitement, the nerves and then the confusion. How do I get to my next destination? How long will it take? Do I fly or take the bus? Are there trains? How much will it cost? Is it safe?  Is this the best way? The seeds for Wander Wise were sown.
